# Run one ROS node inside the `uav_ekko` container, under systemd, without leaving a
# second copy behind on restart.
#
#     scripts/run_in_container.sh <package> <executable>
#
# ============================================================================
# THE PROBLEM THIS EXISTS TO SOLVE
#
# `docker exec` DOES NOT PROPAGATE TERMINATION. Kill the exec client and the
# process it started keeps running inside the container. So the obvious unit —
# ExecStart=docker exec uav_ekko ros2 run ... — behaves like this:
#
#     systemctl restart uav-groundstation
#       -> systemd SIGTERMs the exec CLIENT, which dies
#       -> the node inside the container KEEPS RUNNING, still holding :8090
#       -> systemd starts a new client, which starts a SECOND node
#       -> the second dies with "address already in use"
#
# and the journal shows a crash, not a leftover. The fix is three layers,
# because each covers a case the others do not:
#
#   1. SWEEP ON THE WAY IN (below, and ExecStartPre). Kill any orphan BEFORE
#      starting. This is the one that matters: it works even when the PREVIOUS
#      stop failed — container was down, docker daemon was restarting, the unit
#      was SIGKILLed. A stop path that must always have worked is not something
#      to rely on; sweeping on entry is.
#   2. TRAP AND FORWARD (below). SIGTERM to this wrapper kills the process
#      INSIDE the container, so the normal systemd stop works rather than
#      depending on ExecStop being correct.
#   3. ExecStop in the unit. Backstop for the case where this script itself is
#      gone.
#
# THE KILL TARGET IS THE INSTALL-SPACE PATH, NOT THE NODE NAME. After `ros2 run`
# execs the node, the live process's argv is
#
#     /root/robotx_ws/install/uav_groundstation/lib/uav_groundstation/ground_station
#
# Matching on `ground_station` alone would also match a neighbouring node whose
# name contains it, plus any editor, tail or grep someone left open in the
# container. The install-space path cannot match anything else on the machine.
# The unit's ExecStartPre/ExecStop must use the SAME string — it is printed at
# startup so a mismatch is visible rather than silent.
