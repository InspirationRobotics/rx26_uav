"""Autonomy-drop switch latch — the state machine behind the RC override gate.

Context: an autonomous node that overrides RC sticks does not release them just
because the pilot flips a mode switch. The pilot's only recovery paths are then
Ctrl+C (needs WiFi — not a safety tool) or the hardware kill. This latch closes
that gap: a dedicated RC channel, read via the Pixhawk (so it works at ELRS
range, far beyond WiFi), software-latches autonomy OFF and releases all RC
overrides.

WHAT THIS IS NOT: it is not a disarm, and on this vehicle nothing anywhere is.
Tripping releases every overridden channel back to the pilot and leaves the
aircraft flying under manual control. See telemetry_bridge's header for why the
ASV's force-disarm path is deliberately absent here.

Design rules (deliberate, do not weaken):
  * FAIL-SAFE START: overrides are NOT allowed until the latch has seen a fresh,
    valid RC sample with the switch in the SAFE position. No data = no override.
  * TRIP conditions (any -> latched DROPPED):
      - switch channel crosses the drop threshold (pilot commanded drop),
      - channel value 0 (RC link lost / failsafe no-pulses),
      - RC data stale for > stale_timeout (can't verify the pilot has a path in).
  * LATCHED: once dropped, stays dropped. reset() succeeds only when the switch
    is back in SAFE position AND data is fresh — and reset must be an explicit
    operator action (service call), never automatic.
  * This class contains NO ROS/MAVLink code so it can be exercised anywhere;
    enforcement wiring lives in telemetry_bridge (the sole RC-override sender).

This is a software layer ABOVE the hardware kill, never a replacement for it.
