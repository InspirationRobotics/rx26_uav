"""Shared config loader — uav_params.yaml is the single source of truth for
ROS-side parameters.

Consumed by node code for declaration defaults, so a code default can't drift
from the file the launch system loads. Nodes still receive their live values
through normal ROS parameter machinery — this loader only supplies defaults.

WHERE THE FILE LIVES, AND WHY THIS IS NOT PATH ARITHMETIC
---------------------------------------------------------
The params file ships in `uav_bringup`'s share dir, next to the launch files
that pass it to nodes. Resolution order, first hit wins:

  1. $UAV_PARAMS                     — explicit override (bench, CI, a second
                                       airframe, a one-off experiment)
  2. <uav_bringup>/share/config/     — the installed location, via ament
  3. <repo>/uav_bringup/config/      — the source tree, for off-board tooling
                                       that has no ROS workspace sourced

Do NOT "simplify" this into `Path(__file__).parents[N]`. In the INSTALLED layout
this module lives in `install/uav_common/lib/python3.10/site-packages/` while
the config lives in `install/uav_bringup/share/` — different packages, and lib/
and share/ are siblings. No fixed number of `parents` reaches it from here,
which is exactly the bug that killed every node on the ASV at rclpy.init() on
2026-07-29. Ask ament where the package is; keep the relative path only as a
source-tree fallback.

Note the direction: uav_common looks up uav_bringup by NAME at runtime, and has
no build dependency on it. That is deliberate — bringup depends on the code
packages, never the reverse. The cost is that a workspace with the code but no
bringup installed has no params, which `load()` reports loudly rather than
falling back to invented defaults.
