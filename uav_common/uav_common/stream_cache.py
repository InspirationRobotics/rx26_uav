"""StreamCache — a last-known value that knows how old it is.

The bug this exists to prevent: the ASV's telemetry_bridge cached the last frame
from each MAVLink stream and republished it at 20 Hz with `header.stamp = now`,
with no check that MAVProxy was still delivering. When the gateway died the last
frame was rebroadcast forever, timestamped as if it had just arrived.

That is worse than publishing nothing, because it defeats the consumers built to
notice silence. On an aircraft it is worse still: ocs_client is required to send
a 2 Hz heartbeat and is equally required NOT to invent one, and a frozen cache
turns "we lost the link" into a stream of confident, wrong positions being
relayed onward for Network Remote ID.

So: a cached value is only ever handed out with an explicit freshness check, and
going stale is a loud, one-shot event rather than silence. `now` is a
caller-supplied monotonic seconds value so tests drive time deterministically.

No ROS imports.
