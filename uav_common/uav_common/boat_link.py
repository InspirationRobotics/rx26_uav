"""boat_link -- the bytes Ekko and Crusader exchange over the RFD900ux mesh.

PURE: struct packing and the bookkeeping around it; no ROS, no MAVLink import,
no other uav_common module (fake_crusader.py runs on a bare laptop with this
file beside it). Every radio on the mesh (Ekko, the ground laptop, Crusader, a
laptop standing in for Crusader) packs and unpacks with THIS file, so the ends
cannot drift apart.

CARRIED BY MAVLINK `TUNNEL` (128 bytes of vendor payload per message): the mesh
also carries QGC and the autopilots' own telemetry, and Ekko's Pixhawk parses
every byte it hears, so anything we send must be a MAVLink frame. Each frame
costs about 17 bytes of envelope, which is why each packet below carries
everything of its kind at once rather than one fact per packet.

NO FIELD NAMES ON THE AIR: the order of the bytes IS the meaning. The shapes (v3):

  POSITIONS  drone -> all   map(1) count(1), then per buoy  slot(1) id(2)
             lat(4) lon(4). Sent when a buoy's light is first decided, again
             whenever its mapped position moves by MOVE_M, and the WHOLE map
             every REFRESH_S -- so a listener that joins late, restarts, or
             lost a packet has the map within one refresh, acknowledged or not.
  LIGHTS     drone -> all   every second: map(1), the confirmed gate or exit
             (two slots, 0 = none), then ONE BYTE per buoy -- slot in the top 5
             bits, light in the bottom 3. It is the WHOLE current map: a slot
             missing from it is a buoy that is no longer on the map, and every
             receiver drops it.
  BOAT       boat -> all    every second: lat(4) lon(4) activity(1) target
             slot(1), a 32-bit mask of the slots whose positions the boat HOLDS
             (that mask is the acknowledgement), and optionally map(1) -- which
             map those slots belong to.
  TEST       anyone -> all: a text line the ground station's Radio tab puts on
             the air so an operator can watch one known frame cross it.
             NEITHER VEHICLE ACTS ON IT.
  GNSS       drone -> all   every second while fresh: mode(1) satellites(1)
             h-accuracy cm(2) v-accuracy cm(2), from Ekko's Septentrio ITSELF.
             For the ground laptop: the autopilot cannot say "HAS" (ArduPilot
             4.7 has no fix type for the receiver's PPP mode), and the laptop's
             page only knows what crosses this link. NOTHING ACTS ON IT.

THE MAP NUMBER, AND WHY v2 NEEDED IT. v2 sent each buoy's position ONCE, keyed
by buoy_mapper's tracker id -- and the tracker restarts its ids at B1 on every
"Clear buoys". At the park on 26 Sep 2026 the manual flights had used B1-B10,
the map was cleared, and the autonomous search then found ten buoys of which six
(B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B9) had ids the sender had already sent: their positions
never went out, and their lights went out under the OLD buoys' slots. The ground
laptop showed 4 of 10; a boat that had heard the first map would have put the
new lights on the old positions. Now every map gets a number, slots restart per
map, and a receiver that hears a new number throws the old map away. The v2
payload types (32770, 32771) are retired rather than re-shaped, so an old
decoder ignores v3 packets instead of misreading them.

SLOTS, NOT TRACKER IDS, ON THE AIR. buoy_mapper numbers every track it ever
starts, false ones included, so ids are not 1-10 in a real session. Each buoy
gets a radio slot 1-31 within its map the first time its position is sent, and
the POSITIONS record carries its real id, so every receiver still labels it
"B7". A slot is never reused within one map, so a merged-away buoy's number can
never come back meaning someone else.
