"""run_node — the one canonical entry point for every UAV node.

Fixes three defects of the naive init/spin/shutdown idiom:

  1. Constructor failure: our nodes fail loudly by design (bad endpoint, bad
     geofence, unreachable OCS host). Construction happens INSIDE the try and
     the finally guards `node is not None`, so the original exception
     propagates cleanly instead of being masked by UnboundLocalError, and rclpy
     still shuts down.
  2. `ros2 launch` shutdown surfaces as ExternalShutdownException, not
     KeyboardInterrupt — both are caught; `try_shutdown()` is idempotent where
     `shutdown()` raises if the context is already down.
  3. SIGTERM (systemd units, `docker stop`, and — on this vehicle especially —
     `scripts/run_in_container.sh` forwarding a stop inward) is converted to a
     normal exception so destroy_node() runs: thread joins, MAVLink close, OCS
     link close. That honours the deterministic-teardown rule on ALL exit
     paths, not just Ctrl+C. Exit code 143 (128+15) is preserved for
     supervisors.
