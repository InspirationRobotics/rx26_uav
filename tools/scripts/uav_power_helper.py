"""uav_power_helper — the only thing on this aircraft that may power it off.

Runs on the JETSON HOST as root, under systemd, outside every container. Listens
on a Unix socket, accepts two words, and refuses everything else.

    sudo bash setup/install_jetson_host.sh     # installs + enables the unit
    systemctl status crsd-power

WHY IT EXISTS. The ground station runs inside `uav`, and a container has no init
of its own to ask — `shutdown` in there cannot power off the machine. The usual
workaround is to run the container --privileged with the host PID namespace,
which works by giving every process in it root on the Jetson: the inference
stack, the MAVLink bridge, all of it, permanently, to buy one button. This is
the small version of that grant. One socket, two verbs, no arguments.

THE RULE THAT MAKES IT SAFE, and the only one that matters: NOTHING A CLIENT
SENDS IS EVER INTERPOLATED INTO A COMMAND. The verb selects one of two fixed
argv lists compiled into this file. There is no path, no flag, no delay and no
message taken from the wire. A client that sends something unrecognised gets
"refused" and the connection closed. Read this file before changing it: the
moment a client-supplied string reaches a subprocess, this stops being a helper
and becomes remote root.

The `reason` field is accepted, length-capped, and used for NOTHING but the
journal line. It never reaches a command.

WHO MAY CONNECT is decided by filesystem permissions on the socket, not by
anything in this protocol. The unit creates it 0660 root:crusader, so the
socket is reachable by the crusader group and by containers it is mounted into.
There is no authentication beyond that, which is the same trust boundary as
being able to reach the Jetson's SSH port — and is why the ground station keeps
its own arming interlock and type-to-confirm on top.

# THE SOCKET LIVES IN A DIRECTORY OF ITS OWN, and that is not cosmetic.
#
# The container reaches this socket through a bind mount, and a bind mount of a
# FILE pins the inode that existed when the container started. serve() below
# unlinks and re-binds on every start, which makes a NEW inode — so with
# `-v /run/uav-power.sock:/run/uav-power.sock`, one `systemctl restart
# uav-power` leaves the container holding a deleted inode. The System tab then
# reports the helper unreachable until the CONTAINER is restarted, and nothing
# on either side logs a reason.
#
# Mounting the DIRECTORY instead (`-v /run/uav:/run/uav`) means the container
# resolves the name on each connect and picks up the new socket immediately.
# It also removes the older trap where Docker, asked to bind-mount a path that
# does not exist yet, invents a DIRECTORY at it on the host: a directory is now
# exactly what belongs there.
