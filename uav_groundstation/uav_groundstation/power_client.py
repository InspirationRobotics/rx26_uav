"""power_client — ask the HOST to power down, from inside the container.

WHY THIS IS NOT `subprocess.run(["sudo", "shutdown"])`. The ground station runs
inside `uav`. A container shares the host's kernel but has no init of its own to
talk to, so `shutdown` and `systemctl poweroff` inside it either fail outright
or, if the container is privileged enough, do something worse than nothing. The
container genuinely cannot power off the machine, and no amount of sudo changes
that.

The alternative usually reached for is running the container --privileged with
the host PID namespace, which does work — by handing every process in the
container root on the Jetson. That is a large permanent grant to buy one
button, and it applies to the inference stack and the MAVLink bridge too.

So instead there is a HOST-SIDE HELPER with exactly two verbs. It runs as a
systemd unit outside every container, listens on a Unix socket, accepts the
words "shutdown" and "reboot" and nothing else, and refuses anything it does
not recognise. The socket is bind-mounted into `uav`. The privileged surface is
one file, two verbs, and no arguments — the helper never interpolates anything
a client sent into a command.

  tools/scripts/uav_power_helper.py     the helper
  tools/systemd/uav-power.service       the unit that runs it

If the socket is not there, this client says so plainly and the page disables
the buttons with that reason attached. A power control that silently does
nothing is worse than one that is visibly absent — someone will press it twice,
conclude the aircraft is wedged, and go pull the battery.
