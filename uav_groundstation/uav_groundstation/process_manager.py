"""process_manager — start and stop the aircraft's nodes as child processes.

No ROS imports. The ROS half of "is it running" (the node graph) lives in the
node, because only the node can ask; this file knows about the processes IT
started, which is a different and smaller question.

WHY BOTH ANSWERS ARE NEEDED. A node started by core.launch.py, by systemd, or
by someone in another terminal is running, and the page must say so — nobody
wants a dashboard that reports the telemetry bridge is down because it did not
personally start it. That answer comes from the ROS graph. But the page may
only STOP what it owns: killing a process this server did not spawn means
guessing at a PID from a node name, and getting that wrong on an aircraft kills
something else. So: presence is global, control is local, and the page shows
the difference rather than pretending it does not exist.

TERMINATION IS SIGTERM, THEN SIGKILL. Every node in this repo routes SIGTERM
through uav_common.node_main into a normal exception so destroy_node()
runs — thread joins, MAVLink close, override release. Going straight to
SIGKILL would skip all of that, which for telemetry_bridge means leaving RC
overrides latched in the autopilot. The escalation exists only for a process
that has stopped responding at all.
