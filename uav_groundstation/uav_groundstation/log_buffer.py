"""log_buffer — one place to read what every node is saying.

The gap this closes, and it was the clearest one when comparing against the
team's UUV ground station: once systemd or a launch file owns the nodes, their
output goes somewhere the operator is not. Graey's GUI solves it with a Logs
tab over journalctl, and the point stands — a dashboard you have to leave for a
terminal the moment something misbehaves is not doing its job.

WHY /rosout AND NOT journalctl. We are inside the `uav_ekko` container. The host's
journal is on the other side of that boundary: `journalctl -u uav-container`
from in here reads nothing, and mounting /var/log/journal in to fix it would be
a privilege grant made to read a log file.

/rosout has none of that problem and is strictly better suited. Every rclpy
node publishes its logger output there by default, tagged with the node name
and severity, and it crosses the DDS domain — so this sees nodes in OTHER
containers too, which journalctl on this host never would. It needs no mount,
no privilege and no shelling out.

What it does NOT see: output a node wrote straight to stdout/stderr rather than
through its ROS logger, and anything printed before the node finished
constructing — which is exactly when a bad parameter or a missing device kills
it. That half is covered by ProcessManager's per-process tail for children we
started. Between the two, the only blind spot left is a node started by
something else that dies during construction, and that one is honestly named in
the tab rather than papered over.
