"""proc_scan — find running nodes by reading /proc, not by asking ROS.

Borrowed from the team's UUV repo (robotx_graey_2026, api/gui/gui_node.py),
whose reasoning is worth restating: scanning /proc is instant, needs no ros2
daemon, and sees processes started by ANYTHING — a launch file, systemd, or
someone's terminal.

WHY WE RUN IT ALONGSIDE THE ROS GRAPH RATHER THAN INSTEAD OF IT. The two see
different worlds and we need both:

  the ROS graph  sees nodes ACROSS the DDS domain, including other containers.
                 The livox container's driver is a node we can observe and
                 never a process we can find — different PID namespace.
  /proc          sees processes that are not ROS nodes at all. tools/bench/bench_fence.py
                 and tools/lidar_view.py are plain scripts; before this, one
                 started from a terminal showed as STOPPED on the dashboard,
                 which then offered a Start button that would collide on its
                 port. That was a real hole, and this is what closes it.

So: a thing is running if EITHER says so. Neither alone is right.

MATCHING IS ON WHOLE PATH COMPONENTS, which is the subtlety worth copying
verbatim from their implementation — `led_node` must not match
`pixhawk_led_status_node`. A substring test over the command line looks
correct, passes every casual test, and then silently reports the wrong node as
running on the one day it matters.
