"""system_info — CPU, temperature, disk and uptime, read straight from the
kernel.

No psutil, no jtop, no dependency at all: everything here is a file in /proc or
/sys that the Jetson has by definition. Adding a package to the `uav` image so
a dashboard can print a temperature is the wrong trade, and an import that
fails at node start takes the whole ground station down with it.

EVERY READER RETURNS None ON FAILURE rather than raising or inventing a zero.
These paths differ between JetPack releases and are different again inside a
container, so some of them WILL be missing on some machine. A dashboard that
prints "—" for a value it cannot read is telling the truth; one that prints
0 degrees is lying, and 0 is a plausible-looking number that nobody questions.

CONTAINER CAVEAT, and it is not a small one: read from inside `uav`, /proc
belongs to the HOST (the container shares the host's kernel and, on this
fleet, its PID namespace), so CPU, uptime and temperature are the Jetson's and
are what you want. Disk usage is NOT: it reports the container's view of the
filesystem, which is the same underlying device here but need not be. The disk
figure is labelled with the path it measured so the number can be checked
rather than trusted.
